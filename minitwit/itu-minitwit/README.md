# HOW TO GET THIS UP AND RUNNING 

1. Create a new virtual environment in the current directory by typing the following command: `python3 -m venv .env`
2. Activate that environment. This is done by runnning `source .env/bin/activate/` in the same folder you created the environment in.
3. Rebuild the required packages as listed in `requirements.txt` by running `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
4. TBD


## TL;DR;
```shell
python3 -m venv .env
source .env/bin/activate/
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
